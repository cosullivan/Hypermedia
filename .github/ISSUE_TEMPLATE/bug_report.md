**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Your Builder Configuration**
Please provide all of your configuration, so anything related to the Contract Builder.

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Data In**
If you can, provide examples of the data being input into the library.

This for instance, would be the result of running `curl https://api.mydomain.com/my/endpoint/`.

Don't forget to strip out identifying information. It would also help if you truncated large responses to only show a couple of relevant items. 

**Data Out**
If you can, show us exactly what was produced.

This would, for instance, mean showing us the properties on an object that perhaps have not been set correctly.

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
