# Contributing to Hypermedia

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Suggesting a Change

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

0. Raise an issue describing the change you're about to make and the reasoning behind it.
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any Contributions You Make Will Be Under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report Bugs Using Github's [issues](https://github.com/cosullivan/hypermedia/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/cosullivan/Hypermedia/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write Bug Reports with Detail, Background, and Sample Code

Bugs are a lot easier to bash if bug reports have sufficient information in them from the start:

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
  - Provide any output that demonstrates unexpected/buggy results.
  - Bonus points if you can provide an [MRE](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example). Although we understand not everyone can do this.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

Please just follow standard C# coding style. Your IDE should hopefully infer the style rules from the source code.

## License
